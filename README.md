# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Diagnoses

  Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2018, there were 9.6 million cancer-related deaths, 2.09 million being breast cancer. Studies reveal that by avoiding or altering key risk factors, 30% to 50% of cancer deaths can be prevented. Therefore, it is important to begin screening for breast cancer early in order to increase the chances of successful treatments. 

  We aimed to use the Breast Cancer Coimbra data for analysis, which includes multiple attributes related to breast cancer risk. The dataset also includes the breast cancer diagnosis for each patient, allowing us to train a model that will use these variables to predict future diagnoses. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict an individual’s diagnosis based on the quantitative attributes. Furthermore, it is important to verify if the final model is clinically relevant and applicable. By assessing the practical implications of the model’s predictions, we will evaluate its potential utility in assisting healthcare professions identify early-stage breast cancer.

  There were two datasets used in this project, both relating to breast cancer. The first dataset is the “SyntheticDataset.csv” derived from Kaggle which was authored by Vivek Agrawal. This particular dataset is a synthetic dataset from a deep learning model that was trained on the “OriginalBreastCancerCoimbra.csv” dataset, originally found in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The original dataset has 116 instances based on clinical observations from 64 patients with breast cancer and 52 healthy controls. The deep learning model Vivek used was able to create a synthetic dataset with 4,000 instances, creating the dataset found in Kaggle. The models were trained on the synthetic dataset and tested on the original dataset. 

  Within this repository, there are 3 folders:
    - docs: contains the presentation and final report 
    - data: contains the two datasets used in our project
    - src: contains the source code
